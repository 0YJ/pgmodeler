\ingroup libgui
\brief Implements the macros that replaces the Qt's signal/slot connect method for cases
when a slot throws exceptions that need to be treated in the limits of the slot execution
preventing the exception to be redirected to the outside world which may lead to
unexpected behavior and crashes.

 * The expanded macro encloses the slot in a try/catch block inside a
 * lambda function in order to self-contain all exceptions that eventually go
 * outside the slot scope, avoiding undefined behavior and crashes.
 *
 * NOTE: different from the original Qt's connect function, the slot passed
 * to the macro MUST NOT be the reference (address) of the receiver's method.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * > Qt's original
 *		connect(sender, &SenderClass::s_someSignal, receiver, &ReceiverClass::someMethod)

 * > Macro (note the absence of & in slot specification)
