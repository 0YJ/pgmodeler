\ingroup libgui
\brief Implements the macros that replaces the Qt's signal/slot connect method for cases
when a slot throws exceptions that need to be treated in the limits of the slot execution
preventing the exception to be redirected to the outside world which may lead to
unexpected behavior and crashes.
