# PostgreSQL Database Modeler (pgModeler)
# Sub-project: Core library (libpgmodeler)
# Class: OperationList
# Description: Implements the operations to maintain a list of modifications made
#              by the user on database model objects. This class permits that user
#              undo / redo all the operations made.
