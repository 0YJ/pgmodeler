v1.0.0-beta1
------
<em>Release date: November 25, 2022</em><br/>
<em>Changes since: <strong>v1.0.0-beta</strong></em><br/>

<strong>Attention:</strong> pgModeler 0.9.x settings are not compatible with pgModeler 1.0.0-beta1. This way, at the first start of the newer version, some settings will be automatically migrated if the tool detects the configuration files related to 0.9.4 or below in the system! <br/>

<strong>Summary:</strong> the last step prior to the stable release was done with the launching of pgModeler 1.0.0-beta1 today. This development iteration was mainly focused on code refactoring. Of course, despite the main goal, there were some minor fixes and changes but a substantial set of changes was applied to the core code which will not be perceived in the UI. Anyway, the code is now cleaner in some aspects and easier to maintain. <br/>

An important new improvement that is worth mentioning is that the CSV parsing was rewritten based on RFC 4180 which describes the CSV file in detail. That makes that file type loading in pgModeler a little faster as well as more reliable since it's now capable of parsing files generated by third-party software easily, improving the interoperability between the softwares, and, consequently, the users' productivity.<br/>

There was also a redesign in the light theme to make it REALLY light compared to the light theme in the previous alpha and beta releases, so, you'll not notice a single dark element when using the light theme. Still related to themes, a patch was applied in the loading routine and now pgModeler doesn't change randomly the theme color while the user previews the selected one in the appearance configuration. <br/>

In the design view, the magnifier tool received a dedicated action in the top actions bar which can be triggered with F9 when the zoom factor is less than 100%. Also, a bug that was causing the resetting of the fade-out state of objects was fixed and now using the object finder widget or undoing/redoing operations will preserve the fade status of the objects. <br/>

There were also some bug fixes in the database import process related to operators and functions having parameters composed of user-defined types arrays. <br/>

Finally, the complete changelog of this version can be found in the file CHANGELOG.md. <br/>
