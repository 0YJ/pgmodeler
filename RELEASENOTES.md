v1.0.0
------
<em>Release date: February 3, 2023</em><br/>
<em>Changes since: <strong>v0.9.4</strong></em><br/>

<strong>Attention:</strong> pgModeler 0.9.x settings are not compatible with pgModeler 1.0.0. This way, at the first start of the newer version, some settings will be automatically migrated if the tool detects the configuration files related to 0.9.4 or below in the system! <br/>

<strong>Summary:</strong> the journey was really long, full of challenges that almost made me give up everything, but with the support from lots of people around the world, here we're, launching the long-awaited stable version of pgModeler 1.0.0! Since the early days of this project, seventeen years ago, I was anxious about this moment. This tool is the result of a dream of creating something really useful for the open-source community that I admire so much. I can't express in words how proud and joyful I'm about my hard work and the thousands of people that helped me so far. Thank you wholeheartedly to each one that reserved a bit of their time to make a contribution to this project. Your inestimable help was extremely important to keep this project alive and I hope to keep receiving all support needed to take pgModeler to levels even higher in the future! <br/>

The development of pgModeler 1.0.0 took exactly, 398 days and 649 commits producing a total of 435 changes between new features, bug fixes, and improvements. In the UI, Some parts were redesigned, and new icons and dark theme support were added. In the code generation, the PostgreSQL 9.x support was dropped while PostgreSQL 15 was added. The codebase was fully ported to Qt 6 and now pgModeler can take advantage of all improvements introduced by the framework.<br/>
