v1.0.0-alpha
------

<em>Release date: April 11, 2022</em><br/>
<em>Changes since: <strong>v0.9.4</strong></em><br/>

<strong>Attention:</strong> pgModeler 0.9.x settings are not compatible with pgModeler 1.0.0-alpha. This way, in the first start of the newer version, automatic migration of some settings will occur if the tool detects the configuration files related to 0.9.4 or below in the system! <br/>

<strong>Summary:</strong> after long 4 months of working we finally have the first alpha release of pgModeler 1.0! The main goal of this version was to boot up a series of deep improvements in the UI to add visual comfort while using the software. So that was done, this one brings redesigned UI elements and colors, a completely new icon set, and officially introduces the new project logo. <br/>

As promised, pgModeler 1.0 brings a responsive UI, which means, it will adapt the widget sizes and icons according to the screen's resolution. Also, we now have the support for color themes which can be toggled on-the-fly in the appearance settings. For now, it's possible to switch between dark and light themes or, if you prefer, use the system default theme but future updates will allow custom themes. <br/>

Finally, there are a lot of bug fixes and improvements (92 in total) in almost all parts of the tool which improves stability and reliability. For more details about them, please, read the CHANGELOG.md file. <br/>
