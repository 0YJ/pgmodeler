pgModeler - PostgreSQL Database Modeler
Developed by: Raphael Ara√∫jo e Silva (rkhaotix@gmail.com)

PostgreSQL Database Modeler, or simply, pgModeler is an open source CASE tool for modeling PostgreSQL databases that merges the classical concepts of modeling using entity-relationship diagrams with specific features that only PostgreSQL implements. The pgModeler translates the models created by the user to SQL code and apply them onto database clusters from version 8.0 to 9.1.
