PostgreSQL Database Modeler Roadmap
-----------------------------------

This document describes the feature roadmap for later versions of pgModeler. Note that this document can change as many as new ideas are gather from the users. If you desire some new features on pgModeler, please, open an issue detailing it.


Features intended per version
-----------------------------

[0.3.5]

* Fix the compilation process on MacOSX (URGENT).

[0.3.6]
[0.3.7]
[0.3.8]
[0.3.9]

[0.4.0]

* Remove PostgreSQL 8.x support. Because the huge difference of features from 8.x (especially versions from 8.0 to 8.2) and 9.x many workaround must be made. In order to clean the code and facilitate the pgModeler maintainance the 8.x support must be removed. Note: until the release of the version 0.4.0 the support for PostgreSQL 8.x will be fully maintained.
* Release the reverse engeenering plugin. This feature is currently in planning.
